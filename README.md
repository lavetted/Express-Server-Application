# Anime Tracker

I am building a small backend-powered Anime Tracker where:

- Users exist (simple, no auth)

- Anime titles are tracked

- Each anime has reviews (recommended over episodes — simpler)

## Users can:

- View anime

- Add a new anime

- Update anime info

- Delete anime

- Leave reviews for anime

- View everything on a rendered page

- Add data through a form
